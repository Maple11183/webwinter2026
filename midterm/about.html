        <h1>Why I chose the topic of procrastination?</h1>

        <p style="color:darkred;">
            This is my website on procrastination. I chose this topic because I am guilty of procrastinating, so I wanted to learn how it works, what its downsides are, and how I could work on it myself. As I was making this website, I realized that knowing the full background of procrastination made me more productive and less prone to procrastinating! Using the tips and skills that I mentioned on my homepage to avoid procrastination. And in the future, I would love to expand on this topic as I find it very interesting and useful to learn to prevent procrastination as much as possible.
